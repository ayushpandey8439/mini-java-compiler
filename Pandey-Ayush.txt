Grade: 1.0

Documentation
- Not sure what the purpose of the listings is, you are basically just stating the method signatures
- An introductary sentence would help the reader; similarly, the connection between some (sub-)sections is abrupt
- Little justification for design decisions
+ Good level of abstraction
- Hint: Don't use colons at the end of a heading
+ All relevant aspects are covered
- Unexpected uppercase letters in sentences ("We")

Reflection
- Unepxected lowercase words ("i")
- Some expressions are qualifying your statements in an odd and imprecise way ("I can safely say", "I find X relatively better", " I definitely overlooked", "If i had to implement things", "I tried doing such things")
- Descriptions are rather high-level, only few examples

Implementation
Analysis
- More parameters than expected bug
- null edge cases

Translator
- functions can't use fields of objects
- null edge cases
